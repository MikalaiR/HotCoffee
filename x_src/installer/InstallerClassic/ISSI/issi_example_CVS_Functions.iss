The most likely CVS opration you might encounter in
the setup compiling part of the publishing process
is 'checking out' a clean copy or 'exportrting' a
new version of a software release.

Functions that manipulate the CVS repository are
normally not needed in the publishing process. That
is whi ISSI does not support 'commit', 'update',
'merge' and other repository changing commands. If
you have specific needs it can be implemented very
easely.

NOTE: Deletion on the export folder is needed to
      get the correct new updated files from the
      repository. (ie. Export does not overwrite)
