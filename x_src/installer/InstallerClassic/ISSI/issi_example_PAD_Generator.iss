What is PAD?
PAD is the Portable Application Description, and it
helps authors provide product descriptions and
specifications to online sources in a standard way,
using a standard data format that will allow webmasters
and program librarians to automate program listings.
PAD saves time for both authors and webmasters.


This example shows the ISSI implementation of the
Portable Application Description XML file support.

ISSI will create a new PAD file to go with your
published application.

It takes it's PAD data from the "pad.ini" located in
the "ISSI/Include" subfolder. This ini file all in-
formation regarding your application(s).

To use the PAD functionality of ISSI copy the ISSI
example entry and adjust your application information
accordingly. Once you have an entry for your app
you can use it as described in this example script.

By writing the variables to the ini file you can add
control over your DAP info from within Inno Setup.

The best way to fully use the PAD feature is to
combine the batch generation functions with PAD
creation. That way you can read the file size of your
setup and automatically add it to the PAD.INI before
you export the updated PAD file.

Then you could add an upload feature for all the files
through ISPP so you can really publish with on click of
a button.

One of the best ways to start your PAD file is using
PAD-Gen to quickly set up the pad for your application

More information about PAD and the PAD-Gen can be found
here: http://www.asp-shareware.org/pad/
